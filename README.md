## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
- Dart SDK https://dart.dev/get-dart
- Chrome or Chromium browser

## Getting Started

To run locally on the web:

1. Install dependencies:
`flutter pub get`

2. Add a .env file to the root of the application which includes:
```
TEST=false
```
to run in testnet mode, set TEST=true

3. Much of the web app relies on code generation. To generate the necessary code, run:
`flutter pub run build_runner build`

4. Run the app

    - To run the application as a web app:
            `flutter run -d Chrome`


    - To run the application as a chrome extension:
        a. build the application
            `flutter build web --web-renderer html --csp`


        b. open your Chrome browser and navigate to chrome://extensions

        c. enable Developer mode on the top right corner of the extensions page

        d. click the "Load unpacked" button

        e.  Select the `<flutter_project_dir>/build/web` folder.

    - To use a Chrome substitute (such as Chromium), export the following from your shell env:
    `export CHROME_EXECUTABLE=$(which chromium)`
